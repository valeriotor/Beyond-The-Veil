Due to its transparency it can be hard for us to identify it, and it proves even harder for small Ictya, which won't flee even when it closes in on them.<BR>The Adeline got its name from its discoverer: Saint Adeline, wife of the legendary hero Saint Jerome with whom she ventured into Arche to hunt the Deep Ones.<BR>Rumour has it that it was actually Jerome who found it first, but that in his pride he didn't want his name attached to an oversized sea slug.",
  "ictya.bonecage.description": "The Bonecage is an unsettling eel-like large Ictya. Due to its size, it might attack us when hungry.<BR>It's fast, strong and incredibly resilient. It attacks by opening up the boney spikes on its head, then violently closing them on the target as if to encase it in a veritable bone cage. Huge range and the tendency to pull targets in after hitting them means one would do best to avoid its attacks, and try circling it as much as possible to attack it from behind.",
  "ictya.cephalopodian.description": "A large sized squid-like Ictya, the Cephalopodian is a fearsome creature which may be a threat to us when hungry.<BR>It attacks by closing its \"mouth-head\" on the unfortunate prey. If taken from behind it can also flail its tentacles dealing high knockback, but virtually no damage.<BR>Due to the high damage dealt by its mouth it is preferable to circle it and attack it from behind on its tentacles, though their flailing may prove itself a hindrance.<BR>It is rumoured that within the flaps of its mouth there is a pair of red and blue eyes, though no one has concrete proof of it as of yet.",
  "ictya.deep_angler.description": "Small predators found everywhere throughout Arche, Deep Anglers pose little threat to us, generally only preying on tiny Ictya.<BR>They follow an intriguing hunting pattern: when they're hungry and no prey is beside them, they will lure one from afar, then close in quickly once it gets near enough. One wonders whether we could learn from this.",
  "ictya.dreadfish.description": "Dreadfishes are medium sized Ictya. This means that, while generally hunting for smaller prey, they may assail us as well if very hungry.<BR>They are fast and strong, and compared to most other Ictya they have a much closer bond between each other. Attacking one Dreadfish makes all its close by kin retaliate against the offender. This may be used to our advantage: if we get a large sized Ictya to accidentally attack a single Dreadfish, then those nearby will also join the fight.<BR>Just like crows, a large number of Dreadfishes is called a \"murder\", but for very different reasons.",
  "ictya.man_o_war.description": "Contrary to popular belief, the Man O' War is not a jellyfish. It is, instead, a colony of small organisms that live together in harmony. This is most apparent when observing the Ictya's attack pattern: rather than chasing the enemy itself, it generates small creatures, each known as a \"Jelly\", which close in on the enemy to damage it, feeding the Man O' War when the target is slain.<BR>They are medium sized, and thus won't attack us unless very hungry.",
  "ictya.muray.description": "Murays are found in the caves of Arche. They're small predators, and generally only attack the smallest of Ictya, though if hungry they may prey on creatures of their size.<BR>They don't pose a threat to us, though they will retaliate if attacked.<BR>Quite beautiful to look at when they slither through the waters of Arche. A bit less so when their three-sided jaws are open wide.",
  "ictya.octid.description": "Easily the most annoying Ictya I've ever encountered, these little jerks are at the bottom of the food chain and never fight back against larger predators. However, as you may have already learned, they tend to flee when a possible predator gets too close, while also spraying pink ink right in their face. Unfortunately they do not distinguish between predator and regular passerby, and might blind you at most inopportune times. Perhaps in the Deep Cities we can find a solution.<BR>At least, the Octids make for a fine food source - stay some distance away from them, then close in quickly to attack before they have a chance to blind you.",
  "ictya.sandflatter.description": "One of the most insidious creatures of Arche, the Sandflatter is a lobster-like large Ictya found in the more level regions of Arche. Unlike most other Ictya, it has a clear preference towards you Players, and will always be a threat when one gets unfortunately close.<BR>The small tentacle atop its back is merely a bait for unlucky fools, and if you don't escape the subsequent attack quickly you might not live to regret it.<BR>Once it has dislodged itself from its ambush position, it will chase the victim - if still alive - and rapidly whip down its health with its claws. Its sturdy exoskeleton provides resistance to damage to the Sandflatter unless it is attacked from below, on its softer belly - which is where you should always attack it.<BR>Yes, I should have told you that before you killed one. Apologies.",
  "ictya.sarfin.description": "The most populous inhabitants of Arche, sarfins are at the very bottom of the food chain, and serve as the primary food source for most larger Ictya, as well as you.<BR>They will never fight back, but are prone to fleeing when a larger creature gets too close. Due to their small size, hunting them can get both hard and frustrating. Try staying some small distance away from them, then quickly close in to attack before they have a chance to escape.",

The squid part being obvious, the human attribute was given to it by its ancient discoverers when they mistook its flailing tentacles for a human swimmer's legs, used for propulsion in water.<BR>That's where the similarities end, however. The Umancala is a bizarre looking medium sized Ictya, generally preying on smaller Ictya and seldom attacking us, unless very hungry. They hunt by generating extremely hot balls of boiling water which are then fired towards targets, akin to a Blaze's fireballs in the Nether.",

How ironic, though meaningful, that those shapeless chaotic slugs are so attracted by the perfect, orderly shape of common salt!<BR>The slug bait must be placed in water. There must be no water on top of it, but it must be surrounded by water on its 4 sides. For best performance it should be in the center of an 11x11 square of water.<BR>If the requirements are met, and I am able to see the faintest of particles, I should soon see the watery essence of the slugs on the water surface.

I can then interact with him with bare hands to be given all materials he gathered.<BR>A much more useful technique however is that of binding the Summons to a nearby chest before using it.
